# aside

## Definition and Usage

The `<aside>` tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

Tip: The `<aside>` content is often placed as a **sidebar** in a document.

Note: The `<aside>` element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the `<aside>` element.
